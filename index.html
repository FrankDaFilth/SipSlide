    <h2>The Functionality  Consumers Want , The Sustainability the Planet Needs.</h2>
    <p>SipSlide can lids are easy-open, re-closable, liquid-tight and spill-proof.

      SipSlide is great for outdoor adventures, commutes, school lunches, concerts, the office, and bars/restaurants!

      aluminum packaging as they seek more sustainable solutions.

      slide open to drink the beverage, and slide back to re-close (then open/re-close over and over again!). </p>

      “close the loop” by providing a 100% recyclable solution with the reclosability of plastic.  Our one-of-a-kind
      innovation is built with the planet in mind.  See more about our sustainability and recyclability initiatives
